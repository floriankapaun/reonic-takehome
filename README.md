# reonic-takehome

I used [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for these tasks. If you don't have it installed, it's a single command away. Check their [official installation guide](https://bun.com/docs/installation). Node.js should work just as well.

## [Task 1](./task_01/)

The script is intentionally simple and pragmatic, focusing on functionality without unnecessary complexity.

It has no dependencies so you can run it via:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

or 

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types index.ts
```

## [Task 2a](./task_02a/)

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To start a development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

To run for production:

```bash
bun start
```
